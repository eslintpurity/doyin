It was the 23rd day of the Month Juxaphon, in the high city of Lagosvbn, located far east of kuproton rock and north of Lambodi in the planet of Demsimma. It is the abode of the planet  geghen, the youngest member of the Dem sum family, belonging to Oxghmen galaxy. Oxghmen galaxy is 1055km away from the Earth Milky way Galaxy. The horsesplanet is a beautiful and glamorous planet with sunlight infused right within the core of the plane. There was high and extreme sonorous noise, chats and drums of light filled the whole country. Girls volumnously daancing, horses riding and.......It was my coronation day. I was to be crowned the King of Mamila - the 1st of its kind, the gengendenden of Mamila planet, the holder of the supreme truth and commander in chief of the armed forces of the great luxemmburg Galaxy. 

Let me quickly tell you about the reign, there all planets from certain region combine to form a single king that overseas the affairs of that region. This time, my region had 2.6 billion stars. We conquered Intergalaxy travelling millions of years ago....and very close to bridging the gap to a new parallel universe.  Mamila is located in the Northern Region of the Luxemburg galaxy, King from this region, by extension overseas the reign of Luxemburg planet. In all, four regions, there are approximately 5.6 billion stars

Next, I was joyfully, singing and merrying with great merriment, my entourage following my orders, singing and chatting, My head sudeenly boosted due to the happiness and I started singing Forever, I wanna live forever young, do you really wanna live forever, and ever My entourage took it up and all were bursting up with the blissful merriment. As I repeated it, the second time, a known dejavu started ceeping in, my euroria was slowing down.  I tried to raise the tempo, but my subconcious mind kept fighting back, telling me merriment is about to be over, the more I tried, the more reality (or so called reality) started opening up. What is about happening to my entertainment, my forever young, my beautiful princess and charming Queen? my entourage, supreme holder of the Luxemburg Galaxy? bla bla bla...

Oh, it was J-zay! why? why?? oh why??? I had left my system on while songs was playing...J-Zay, forever young. My mind had been following songs from my system while I dosed off. My subciousness mind somehow interwined it with my merriment in my fathomed galaxy. I woke up lying flat in my bed, skaken, bamboozed, confused and gladdened at the same time. All I uttered was why the fuck did I wake up?

Been training had since then to enter such abode once more. This time around, I'll make the death permanent. Then I'll die only to live and reign.

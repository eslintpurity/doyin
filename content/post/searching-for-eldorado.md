+++

Gone are the days when spirituality was the order of the day. It was slow to solve the ever changing problems  man keepp facing and needed to get solved. The mantra remians to keep forward and profer a solution that would at least prove to be the right answer towards our problems. Well they gave us science and technology, which proved as the right and quick candiadte to solve our problems. This has in a great deal delimited the real powers of the human mind. Think time travelling its a thing of the future.. My people had solved this years ago. but then it was used in a more negative ways. Yorubas will say (Egbe gbe) -meaning you've just time-travelled from an unknown origin. But then I respect the orders of the elders cos pracical spirituality had been tested and once failed the society. Thus, giving us what can truly be tested with time such as religion, science and technology but that doesn't limit the fact of true spirituality. were only few chosen ones can clearly see. I am still searching for the eldorado. the golden city within me. Hope to find it and trancend beyond this world one day.

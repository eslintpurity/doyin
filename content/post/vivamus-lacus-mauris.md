It was the 23rd day of the Month Juxaphon, in the high city of Lagosvbn, located far east of kuproton rock and north of Luxemburg in the country of Demsimma. It is the abode of the planet  geghen, the youngest member of the Dem sum family, belonging to Oxghmen galaxy. Oxghmen galaxy is 95km away from the Earth Milky way Galaxy. The horsesplanet is a beautiful and glamorous planet with sunlight infused right within the core of the plane. There was high and extreme sonorous noise, chats and drums of light filled the whole country. Girls volumnously daancing, horses riding and.......It was my coronation day. I was to be crowned the King of Mamila (The Northern Region)...the 1st of its kind, the holder of the supreme truth and commander in chief of the armed forces of the great planet. 

Let me quickly tell you about the reign, there all planets from certain region combine to form a single king that overseas the affairs of that region. This time, my region had 1.6 billion planets. We conquered Intergalaxy travelling millions of years ago....and very close to bridging the gap to a new parallel universe. 

Next, I was joyfully, singing and merrying with great merriment, my entourage following my orders, singing and chatting, I wanna live forever young, do you really wanna live forever, forever......I had left my system on while songs was playing...J-Zay, forever young. My subciousness mind had been following songs from my system while I dosed off. I woke up lying flat in my bed, confsed and gladdened at the sam time. All I uttered was why the fuck did I wake up?

Been training had since then to enter such abode once more. This time around, I'll make the death permanent.

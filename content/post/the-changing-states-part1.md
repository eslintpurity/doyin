+++

The changing states are my collection of quotes on positivity, spirituality, wisdom, friendship, marriages, health and jokes. They are meant to remind you of who you truly are. You're a warrior. A warrior may fall and fail many times but never quit. Don't give up my friend. Pick yourself up each time you're hit. This world is only an entrace to another world. Its meant to teach you growth. Yes! you're meant to keep growing. Its a puzzle we all need to crack individually and collectively. DONT GIVE UP! its not over yet. Be inspired.

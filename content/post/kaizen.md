It was a saturday morning. Prior to the dawn, I had worked straight up for nearly 72hours with little rest. Roughly 95% of the time was spent battling with system errors, debungings, missing files and templates and windows installations bizzare. I tried but all to no avail. No solution. After so much failed efforts, the normal bebugging mode crept in on me - spiralled head craziness, walking-talkings, strong grinned face, immediately followed by an internal weakness like a dried bone, I started questioning and thinking out loud why on earth did I find myself in this profession? am I even for real? oh aliens plz come capture me..bla bla bla - whinning like a child. Am sorry if you're not in this category, software developers understand better. 

Well, I woke up feeling slightly better but still wish I haven't picked up programming as a career. Suddenly I felt a little spark in my head, I picked it up immediately..tapped in its energy, tracked down the problem and fixed in in less than an hour.

Oh my....? euphoria foolish-childish smile grinned all over myself. I WAS FULLY BACK TO LIFE. Jumped up, picked up a ball and hit accurately at a targeted sharp angle 90degress. Such was the intensity of my recovered energy. I immediately conviced myself and retract back programmming as the best profession in the world. Mind you, you may chew you words back when debuggings crept you in on you seconds later. Its just the EVIL you're meant to learn how to love and keep as a friend. Its the ugly truth but the smartest way to keep yourself happy. Its only get better with LORD DEDUGS.

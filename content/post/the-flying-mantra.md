Flying either by man made device or physical flying had alwaz been frowned upon and bamboozed by our society. Debunking all records claimed of man's flight in history. Before the advent of aeroplane, the American Society of Aeronautical Engineering claimed it is practically impossble to fly anyting metallic in the air. Hmmm! was it impossible?...I guess..? Curious minds searched and looked deep and brought out the embedded gift in them, envisioned it and saw a clear picture of possibility. They watched bird fly and thus modelled the flight after birds flight. Ever since, human  that profered countless of solutions to our planet using animal simulations. Some of these modelling include ANN, Particle Swarm Optimization, genetic algorithm to mention just a few.

Oh keep that shit to yourself you say! - thats animal modelling. But can man really fly? 

My name is Doyin ELUGBADEBO, and this is my story. I CAN FLY! shmhhhh, its a secret between me and you. Plz don't leak it out....
